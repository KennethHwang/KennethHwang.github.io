### Analysis

**Who runs the prison?**  
Game theory, the inmates control their own circumstances, as a whole  

Inherantly badly designed system structure

Misses some aspects of current capitalistic societyâ€”captures inequality but doesn't capture how it's much easier for the powerful to retain and exploit their power and position in order to remain in a position of power.   
The novelty here is that they are all movable positions since any prisoner can move from the highest floors to the lowest from one month to the next.  

Now, what difference is there between being at a high or a low level? The answer is simple: life or death.


seems clear Administration doesn't have good info and doesn't really know what goes on inside  
not clear whether there actually is enough food to adequately feed everyone, even if properly portioned  
human nature in circumstances of abundance and scarcity
