<p><strong>Meditation helps develop internal locus of control</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Meditation is a skill with life changing potential</li>
  <li>You decide it’s purpose by deciding how to use it</li>
  <li>It can be applied to any aspect of life and the value of it is equal only to the value you place upon it.</li>
  <li>Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s about training in awareness and understanding how and why you think and feel the way you do, and getting a healthy sense of perspective in the process. It just so happens that when you do that, any changes you want to make in your life become that much more feasible. More than that, it shows you how to be okay with the way you are right now and how you feel.
For some reason we’ve come to believe that happiness should be the default setting in life and, therefore, anything different is somehow wrong. Based on this assumption we tend to resist the source of unhappiness—physically, mentally and emotionally. It’s usually at this stage that things get complicated. Life can begin to feel like a chore, and an endless struggle to chase and maintain that feeling of happiness. We get hooked on the temporary rush or pleasure of a new experience, whatever that is, and then need to feed it the whole time. It doesn’t matter whether we feed it with food, drink, drugs, clothes, cars, relationships, work, or even the peace and quiet of the countryside. If we become dependent on it for our happiness, then we’re trapped. What happens when we can’t have it any more? And what happens when the excitement wears off?<br />
For many, their entire life revolves around this pursuit of happiness. Yet how many people do you know who are truly happy? And by that I mean, how many people do you know who have that unshakeable sense of underlying headspace?</p>

<p>Meditation won’t change the way you feel, but it will change the way you experience those feelings</p>

<p>The starting point is to acknowledge that it’s the mind itself that defines your experience. This is why training the mind is so important. By changing the way in which you see the world, you effectively change the world around you.<br />
I think often this point is misunderstood and people feel as though they have to give up their dreams and ambitions in life in order to practice meditation. But that’s not the case at all. There is something inherently human about striving to achieve something, and having a sense of purpose and direction in life is vital. But, if anything, meditation can be used to clarify and support that purpose, because what the practice will show you, in a very direct way, is that a lasting sense of happiness and sense of headspace is not dependent on these things. This will allow you to live with a greater sense of freedom and ease, confident in where you’re heading in life and yet not so attached to the outcome that an unexpected obstacle or unfavorable outcome will result in heartbreak and loss.</p>

<p>You can keep living as you always have done, if that’s what you want to do. Mindfulness is about learning how to change your experience of that lifestyle. It’s about finding a way to live as you are, but with an underlying sense of fulfillment. And then, if you feel as though you want to make some changes, then of course feel free. The difference is, any changes you make will be sustainable</p>

<p>In becoming more aware of everything and everyone, you inevitably become more aware of others. You start to notice how sometimes you might unintentionally (or even intentionally) push their buttons, or notice what causes them to push yours. You start to listen to what they’re actually saying, rather than thinking about what you’d like them to say or what you’re going to say next. And when these things begin to happen you’ll notice that your relationships with others really start to change. But so long as we’re immersed in our own thoughts the whole time, it’s very difficult to truly find time for others.</p>

<h3 id="stories">Stories</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Sitting on side of road looking as cars go by</dt>
  <dd>Usually blindfolded and don’t notice all the cars zooming past</dd>
  <dd>Even once the blindfold is off and you can see them, you might feel the need to chase after them, rather than just watch as they past by. It’s okay if they happens, when you notice yourself chasing after them, just sit back down</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Given one car in life, how would you take care of it</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt>The mind is clear blue sky, thoughts are clouds going by.</dt>
  <dd>Sometimes lots, sometimes none. Sometimes nice and fluffy, other times dark, gloomy, and heavy, blocking out all of blue sky. But no matter the cloud, behind and past them is always a clear blue sky.</dd>
  <dt>Taming a wild horse—effort</dt>
  <dd>Can’t force a clear mind when you sit down to meditate, just like how you can forcefully tame a while horse, or force yourself to fall asleep. Must give all the space it needs for it to feel comfortable and gently and slowly bring it in</dd>
  <dt>Walk down same path every day</dt>
  <dd>Accustomed to path so don’t really pay much attention, believing you’re already familiar with it<br />
Yet there has been this hole along path for a long time now<br />
When you keep making the same mistake over and over again, it’s like falling into same hole not noticing<br />
you might be falling, much less that there might be holes along path<br />
One day you might notice that you feel like you’re falling<br />
Maybe it makes you confused or upset, but you still might not see hole<br />
But even once you notice you’re falling and conclude that there is a hole, can be so accustomed to routine and keep walking same path, straight into hole<br />
you might try to change path just before falling in but still fall in<br />
With continued practice, you may be able to see hole from farther away and step away before falling in<br />
And then one day you even might notice that there never was a hole to begin with, but that’s a story for another time</dd>
  <dt>Still pool of water</dt>
  <dd>Imagine a very still, clear pool of water. The water is quite deep, but very, very clear. Because the water’s so clear you can see absolutely everything at the bottom, making it appear shallow, even though it’s actually very deep. Now imagine sitting by the side of this water and throwing small pebbles into the middle. Start off quite slowly, just throwing them every now and then. You’ll notice that each new pebble creates a ripple on the surface of the water, and that it takes a little while for the water to then settle again. If you then throw another stone in before the water has completely settled, you create a new set of ripples that merges with the last.</dd>
  <dd>what needs to become clear, will naturally become clear. Meditation is not about rooting around in the recesses of the mind, digging up old memories, getting caught up in analysis and trying to make sense of it all. That’s not meditation, that’s thinking
Allow it to happen at its own pace</dd>
  <dt>The lawn</dt>
  <dd>When faces with an inevitable senseless task/challenge, keep calm and carry on with an open mind and gentle curiosity</dd>
  <dt>The street</dt>
  <dd>“Imagine every day you have to walk to work,” he began. “You walk down the same street, see the same houses, the same people, every day.” I pictured the scene. I’d had several jobs like that in the past, so it didn’t require much imagination. “Toward the end of this street there is a very big hole. Perhaps the workmen have been digging it up to repair the pipes or something, but the hole is very deep and because the workmen have been drinking too much tea, or spent too much time talking, this hole always seems to be there.” He stopped and laughed at the image. “So,” he went on, “even though you know this big hole is there, every day you go down the same street and walk straight into the hole. You don’t mean to do it, it’s just that you’ve got so used to following that particular path, that course of action, that you do it without even thinking.<br />
“Now,” he said, “when you start to meditate it’s like you wake up and become more aware of what’s going on around you. When you walk down the street, you see the big hole in front of you.” “But that’s the thing,” I replied, “I’ve been meditating a lot and although sometimes I see the hole, there’s nothing I can do to stop myself falling down it every time.” He smiled. “Exactly,” he said, “at first you just see the hole, but the habit of walking down that part of the street is so strong that you can’t help but walk straight into it. You know it’s madness, you know that it’s going to hurt, but you just can’t help yourself!”<br />
“This is just how it is with your mind. You see these pitfalls, but the habit is so strong you can’t help yourself from falling. But,” he said, pausing dramatically, “if you continue meditating, you’ll begin to see the hole much earlier and be able to take some evasive action. At first you may try to go around the edge and fall in anyway. This is part of the process. But eventually, with practice, you’ll see it with such clarity that you’ll simply walk around it and continue on your way. This way you’ll arrive at work feeling very fresh.” He chuckled again. “And then one day, you might have so much clarity, you might be so awake, that you realize that there was never a hole there in the first place, but that’s a lesson for another time.”</dd>
  <dt>The Theater</dt>
  <dd>“There’s no such thing as good and bad meditation, there is only distracted or undistracted, aware or unaware.” In fact, he used to liken it to going to the theater.
Imagine you’re watching a play of several acts. Your only role is to sit back, relax and watch as the story unfolds. It’s not your job to direct the performance, neither is it your job to get up on stage and start interfering with the story being told.<br />
“When you sit to meditate it’s a little like watching this play. The images and voices are not you, in the same way that the play or the film is not you. It’s an unfolding story that you’re watching, observing and witnessing. This is what it means to be aware. Your own story, as in your own life, will still require direction and a sense of engagement, but when sitting to observe the mind during your meditation, taking a seat in the audience is by far the best way of watching. And it’s through developing that ability of passive observation that you get to experience the clarity and confidence to make decisions, make changes and live life more fully. Think back to the blue sky, this space that has always been there. Awareness is not something you need to create, as it’s always present. We just need to remember not to forget.</dd>
  <dt>Imaginary lovers</dt>
  <dd>“stealing glances once in a while and then feeding off their projection of those glances the rest of the time. We’ve all done it, right? By the end of the week, it’s no exaggeration to say that some couples had taken that chain of thought so far, that not only had they dated in their minds, but they’d got married, consummated the marriage, had children, and spent time thinking where they might retire to. Some had even got divorced! Even though it was their own story that they were creating, they had still chosen to build in some pain and anguish. Yet they’d never even spoken to the other person. This shows how easy it is to get caught up in all the little stories, the dramas, the hopes and the fears of the mind.<br />
Part of the reason that we get so easily drawn into these stories is that we’re so used to doing something, being involved in something, that it can feel a bit boring to just sit and watch the mind, especially if the thoughts are mundane. We create these stories in an attempt to make things interesting, to get away from the boredom. But have “you ever stayed with boredom long enough to look at what it is? Is it simply a thought or a feeling of wanting to be somewhere else, of doing something different? And if so, then why treat that thought or feeling any differently from all the others you observe in the mind? As you know, just because we experience a thought doesn’t mean we have to react to it, or act upon it”<br />
“Think back to a time when you might have had a thought that was so extreme you laughed at it. In that moment, you saw it for what it was, a crazy thought, no more than that. And so you didn’t give it too much importance and probably let it go. So we have this ability within us, it’s just getting used to the feeling of taking up the position of an observer on a more regular basis</dd>
  <dt>Screaming man</dt>
  <dd>“He continued to think in this way, using one thought to fuel the next, increasing the intensity of his frustration and making it more and more difficult to sit there in the process.<br />
Eventually he reached breaking point. He was no longer conscious of that separation between audience and stage. He was now (metaphorically speaking) up out of his seat, running around the stage and creating mayhem in his wake. He had “become” his thoughts. He was desperate, unable to contain himself for a moment longer.”<br />
“if you’re going to learn a new skill you need the right instructions. It’s no use thinking, “Oh well, how hard can it be to just sit there and watch your own mind?,” because, as the man in the story demonstrated, if you don’t know the right way of watching the mind, then it can be very difficult indeed. The second is that if you’re going to learn how to meditate, then start slowly. There’s nothing wrong with taking just ten minutes to begin with. In fact, this is a long time if you’ve never done anything like this before. In the same way that the body needs to be trained to run marathons, so the mind needs to be trained to sit for longer periods of time. The story also illustrates the danger of waiting for the meditation to finish. It’s a common experience and it’s almost as though we think that by simply sitting there and not moving, we’re meditating, no matter what we’re doing with the mind. But this underlying sense of expectation, of waiting for something to happen, is a mind that is looking to the future, as opposed to a mind resting in “the present. Think about it, how can there ever be a sense of ease resting in the present moment if the mind is hurriedly trying to get to a space and time in the future?</dd>

  <dt>The juggling monk</dt>
  <dd>“In that moment I had all the time in the world. It was as if the balls just hung there in the air. I had time to look at them, each and every one, thinking how I would move this one over to the left a little bit and that one slightly to the right. It was as if someone had pressed a slow motion button, an extraordinary thing. When I quit rushing around in my mind, trying to get from one ball to the next, trying to control every little thing, there was an inexplicable amount of time and space. It might be something to think about given the way we rush around in life. It doesn’t mean you can’t do things quickly and still be mindful—of course you can. It just means that the body moving quickly and the mind being in a rush are two very different things.”</dd>
  <dt>The patient Yogi</dt>
  <dd>Even yogis experiences impatience, like boredom or any other emotion
“To practice mindfulness in everyday life without doing even ten minutes of meditation a day is a bit like trying to build the foundations of a house on loose gravel. It will work, but it will not be anywhere near as stable as if you built it on solid ground. However, the reverse is also true. What good is meditation if it doesn’t change the way you feel and behave in life? Remember, the point of getting more headspace is to make your own life and the lives of the people around you more comfortable. It’s not much good getting all nice and calm if you plan to lose it with the very first person you come into contact with. Try to think about meditation as the platform from which you’ll operate over the next twenty-four hours. That sense of calm will enable you to respond skillfully to situations if you can maintain your awareness. But if you get so caught up with your own story, that you lose all awareness, then you may well find that you react just as impulsively as the yogi.”</dd>

<p>If you can bring a sense of genuine intrigue and curiosity to your meditation, then it doesn’t really matter what those qualities are. That’s because they become part of the meditation, part of that which is observed. One of my teachers always used to describe this quality as gentle curiosity. When this becomes part of your approach to meditation you’ll notice that the mind feels very open. For example, you may well think, much like myself at the time, that if you’ve seen one breath then you’ve seen them all. And if this is your attitude to following the breath, then you’ll undoubtedly lose interest very quickly. But if you take the time to look a little more closely, you’ll notice that each and every breath is actually quite unique. The same can be said of the thoughts that pass through the mind (even if sometimes it feels as though it’s the same one coming back time and again), and even physical sensations that arise in the body.</p>
