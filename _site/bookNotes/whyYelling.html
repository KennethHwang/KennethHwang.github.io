<h2 id="why-are-we-yelling-the-art-of-productive-disagreement">Why Are We Yelling? The Art of Productive Disagreement</h2>

<h3 id="intro--3-myths-about-disagreements">Intro — 3 myths about disagreements</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Disagreements are bad, they’re not—they’re signs of something deeper and can be used productively</li>
  <li>Disagreements are about changing minds
    <ul>
      <li>A disagreement is an unacceptable difference in perspectives. The key word isn’t ‘difference’, it’s ‘unacceptable’</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Disagreements end—they don’t, they will keep coming up again and again</li>
</ol>

<p>Disagreements aren’t necessarily bad, they can actually be good productive things that help foster learning and growth</p>

<p>As our world becomes more blended in terms of cultural traditions and norms, and gives voice to previously disenfranchised demographics, increasingly we can’t assume that everyone around us thinks that our norms are normal. What a reasonable person considers acceptable is a moving target, and we all have to be okay with redefining these boundaries, but this fact also reveals that the boundaries are drawn by consensus and not according to any absolute sense of universal morality.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-try">Things to Try</h3>
<p><strong>1. Watch how anxiety sparks</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Events/differences in views/values sparks anxieties that can cause disagreements</li>
  <li>Key is to identify if differences are in head, heart, hands—what is true, meaningful, useful</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Talk to your inner voices</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The voice of power, Using direct power to end a problem, “end of conversation”, “don’t talk back”</li>
  <li>The voice of reason, Using reasons to end a problem, hinges on underlying power of authority/institution
    <ul>
      <li>Not effective when not belonging in same group that values the underlying source of power/authority/institution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The voice of avoidance, Refusing to address/deal with problems, ignoring them hoping they’ll go away (they won’t)
    <ul>
      <li>Might make sense when conflicts are low stakes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The voice of possibility, trying to understand what might be possible with an open-minded gentle curiosity
    <ul>
      <li>“What are we missing?” “What else is possible?” “Is there another way?”</li>
      <li>The obstacle is the path, uses any spark of disagreement as a jumping-off point to find the source of dissonance
        <ul>
          <li>Gently investigate other views until no longer it’s surprising that differences exist, even if still in conflict</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Show the work behind your decision-making process and invite others to find flaws in it or suggest improvements to it</li>
      <li>Open to suggestions about how to make progress toward shared goals within existing constraints</li>
      <li>Dig deeper into the frustrations, looking for the real wish below the surface of their complaint</li>
      <li>First three see conflict as a problem, the last one tries to make it productive
        <ul>
          <li>Our cultural obsession with short-term wins is part of the reason these problems are here in the first place.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3. Develop honest bias</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“What am I missing?”—Instead of getting angry, get curious</li>
  <li>Accept bias as necessary and permanent as part of what makes us human rather than try to get rid of them</li>
  <li>be honest about own limited capacity to perceive world around us, recognizing this limitation opens us up to the possibility of relying on one another to help fill in the parts of the picture that we can’t see and always being open to new perspectives that we might have missed.
    <ul>
      <li>the more we try to avoid, the more blind we become</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The bias exist to help us solve unavoidable unsolvable problems:
    <ul>
      <li>Head—too much information in word for anybody to process</li>
      <li>heart—not enough meaning</li>
      <li>hands—not enough time and resources
        <ul>
          <li>Have to get things done despite constraints in time, resources, attention, energy, and opportunity, which means always need to leap into action with partial information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Work together to figure out how to work within these unavoidable constraints, focusing on the shared goal</li>
  <li>Accepting bias: Discomfort, failure, and anxiety are the key to our growth and therefore should not be shied away from
    <ul>
      <li>stems from desire for control
        <ul>
          <li>acceptance and letting go of control</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The voice of reason tells us to either find a solution or give up on the problem—either way, focus is to stop feeling bad about it. No final solution our own biological and social limitations in the universe, but can’t ignore problem. need to honestly acknowledge discomfort and keep it alive in us, because it points toward paths for growth. Even no final state to reach, still need to take this path, because it allows us to keep the question open and to feel the discomfort of that open-endedness without losing the ability to function in the world.</li>
  <li>Develop honest bias:
    <ol>
      <li>Opt-in
        <ul>
          <li>Wake up to our own blindness and stop trying to avoid it or pretend it doesn’t exist</li>
          <li>See own blindness</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Observe
        <ul>
          <li>Take steps to reduce the amount of time and energy you spend trying to hide or ignore your biases and blind spots
            <ul>
              <li>Notice when your defenses are triggered and check whether
                <ol>
                  <li>You’re really in danger right now, or</li>
                  <li>There’s an opportunity to learn from a new perspective, even in a small way</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Accept own blindness</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Repair
        <ul>
          <li>Take steps to reduce the time and energy it takes for you to identify and begin to repair inadvertent damage caused by your biases and blind spots
            <ul>
              <li>When you notice a blind spot, look into it and identify people and ideas that may have been undervalued or harmed by you and others. Look for ways to reverse that trend and repair damage</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Understand and update any encountered blindnesses</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Normalize
        <ul>
          <li>Take steps to reduce the time and energy others have to spend challenging your blind spots and recruiting you to address the damage that you’ve contributed to.
            <ul>
              <li>Actively seek out information and perspectives that challenge your own. Invite the best representatives of positions you don’t agree with to productive disagreements. Actively attempt to falsify your own beliefs</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Seek and find own possible blindnesses in order to better understand and update</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>“Strong opinions weakly held”
    <ul>
      <li>Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect—this is the “strong opinion” part. Then—and this is the “weakly held” part—prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that are pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.”
    <ul>
      <li>Floating like a butterfly means we should be willing to change our minds easily and often, always looking for the positions that are a better fit for the situation. Stinging like a bee means that we still need to lean on those positions heavily and make decisions and take decisive action based on them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developing honest bias will eliminate an entire category of unproductive disagreement that comes when we think what we’re seeing is an unfiltered view of reality
    <ul>
      <li>When your beliefs are challenged by others, instead of immediately leaping to conclusion that they’re wrong, you can instead ask yourself if you might be missing something that they can see but you can’t</li>
      <li>Instead of saying “I know I’m right!” say, “I’m not seeing what you’re seeing. Can you help me get there?”
        <ul>
          <li>You don’t have enough information yet to know if what you think they’re say is what they’re actually saying</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Instead of getting angry, get curious</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internalizing this seems like it will be a lifelong effort, like awareness and mindfulness in general</li>
  <li>Contract for accepting that bias exists and opting in to address this fact:
    <blockquote>
      <p>I will try to accept my bias, which means I’m willing to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Acknowledge my limitations and unique perspective.</li>
        <li>Invite diverse perspectives to the table.</li>
        <li>Listen generously when others point out my blind spots.</li>
        <li>Be willing to accept the discomfort that this inevitably brings as a welcome gift.
In some ways that I can see, and other ways that I can’t, I will always be forced to take some strategic shortcuts that systemically neglect certain kinds of information because of constraints of attention, meaning, time, resources, and memory. Nobody can escape bias, including me. Without these strategies, I would become paralyzed by uncertainty.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The strategies that I have to use also systemically neglect certain kinds of information that will disadvantage and harm certain people in a way that I will not be aware of without a lot of work.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Efforts to avoid bias are primarily about seeking comfort, which results in maintaining the status quo.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I must not confuse comfort for growth. Honest bias is rarely comfortable; discomfort is key to my growth, and desirable.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>My biases are reinforced by my surroundings. This includes the communities around me, the products and services that I use in order to stay informed about the world, and even the institutions that I belong to.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is no cure for bias, but it can be managed with honest self-reflection, requests for thoughtful feedback, and a willingness to address feedback directly however it comes to me.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We can’t avoid it, and not addressing it isn’t an option. I can’t allow myself to become paralyzed by the fact that I can never fully trust my own thought processes. I must not give up on trying to remove bias from my thoughts and actions.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Speak for yourself</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two common bad habits
    <ol>
      <li>Speaking for others</li>
      <li>Speculating about the perspectives of groups of people</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Results in the following benefits
    <ol>
      <li>End up inviting people into conversations instead of just talking about them.</li>
      <li>Improve your mental model for other people’s positions much more quickly.</li>
      <li>More accurately represent your own position to them, which means they will be less likely to misrepresent or speculate about yours</li>
      <li>Opens up new interesting questions</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Ask questions that invite surprising answers (and listen generously)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Voice of possibility</li>
  <li>Helps facilitate listening</li>
  <li>The voice of reason would be interested in merging these accounts into a single narrative that worked across all of them. This is the never-ending agenda of the voice of reason, because in order to make sense of each thing it has to connect it back up to all the other things that roll up to the higher authority that gives power to the wielder of reason. The problem with this is that given a choice between accepting something that doesn’t immediately make sense and discarding it, the voice of reason will usually err toward discarding. This creates a real cost over the long term, because new information and perspectives are ignored, often for way too long, even when they might have led to a stronger position.</li>
  <li>The voice of possibility is less interested in integrating all of these accounts than it is in collecting as many conflicting perspectives as possible to put on the table and examine.</li>
  <li>When is all lain out, what kind of questions emerge that we could ask?</li>
  <li>“Belief alignment” is only one reason among many to have a conversation—and it’s not even the most important one. Conversations are much more fulfilling when they function as a way to peek into each other’s lives and talk about the real stuff we’re going through: connecting with an unhappy son, taking on large lifestyle changes, or contemplating our relationship to mystery and the universe.</li>
  <li>When the function of a conversation shifts from the single driven purpose of being right and discovering truth to a broader landscape of open questions and curiosities, the words and language that can be used to describe our experiences and relationships also become more rich. When I asked big open-ended questions, the answers were filled with information I never would have been able to seek out on my own. They gave me a look into the mental models and belief systems of people who see the world fundamentally differently from me, and I was able to acquire some of the language of their minds as well.</li>
  <li>Great questions create space for surprising answers to fill them. If we ask questions that can only yield answers that we already expect, we’ll never be surprised and we’ll never find a new wandering path through the world. But if we ask open-ended questions that have no predetermined answers, we can take steps farther and farther away from where we started. Curiosities can be piqued, and even better questions can be found.</li>
  <li>To ask a good question, walk right up to the perimeter of your current understanding about something and find a question that you don’t know the answer to.</li>
  <li>Battleship vs twenty questions</li>
  <li>What does an answer to the question “Do you think ghosts are real?” reveal about the person answering it that can be used to ask a better follow-up question? What about the question “What experiences have led you to your current beliefs about ghosts?”</li>
  <li>The first question is less likely to surprise you than the second, because even if you don’t know the answer to a yes-or-no question, the spectrum of possible answers is very small, and you probably already have opinions about any answer that could be given. On the other hand, when a question is more open-ended, like the second one, the space of possibility is much larger, and there’s a better chance that you’ll be surprised by the answer. The other benefit is that the individuals answering will probably feel like they’re being given a better opportunity to share their true thoughts.</li>
  <li>A good question requires, therefore, that the dialogue be reliably open and honest, and for there to exist some mutual understanding and trust that the information shared won’t be weaponized. Without that trust, it doesn’t matter how good the question is—the information you get back will be unreliable and potentially even malicious.</li>
  <li>A good question needs to provoke an honest answer from the other player (meaning that there needs to be some agreement that this line of questioning is in good faith on both sides). Only then will it matter whether or not the question receives a surprising answer.</li>
  <li>Four fruits of disagreement
    <ol>
      <li>Security
        <ul>
          <li>Usually only focused on this, voices of power, reason, avoidance</li>
          <li>Other fruits usually built upon foundation of security</li>
          <li>Can be false sense of security that eventually comes back in uglier ways</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Growth
        <ul>
          <li>More risk but higher overall reward</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Connection
        <ul>
          <li>Puts trust and risk in others hands</li>
          <li>Helps gain new perspectives or new edge cases</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enjoyment</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Better questions
    <ul>
      <li>What formative events in your life brought you to this belief?</li>
      <li>What’s really at stake here?</li>
      <li>What’s complicated about your position here that people don’t usually notice at first?</li>
      <li>If what you believe was proven conclusively true to its staunchest opponents, what would happen?</li>
      <li>My only measure in the strength of a question now is in the honesty and eloquence it elicits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The goal is to paint the biggest, most interesting and fruitful picture you can of someone else’s perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Build arguments together</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the shared ideal goal or outcome?</li>
  <li>Focuses on real issue/problem rather than on specific implementations of solutions</li>
  <li>Works to understand all possible solutions and tradeoffs rather than just advocating for specific ones</li>
  <li>Monkey’s Paw</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Cultivate Neutral Spaces</strong></p>
