<h1>One Punch Man</h1>

<p class="view">by Kenny</p>

<h3 id="one-punch-man-is-a-social-commentary">One Punch Man is a social commentary</h3>

<p>The true main character of One Punch-Man is the society of this world. The Hero Association, the civilians, and the other collective heroes are actually the ones experiencing the traditional storytelling journey as a group. Saitama is the antagonist as he challenges all the traditions, hierarchy, culture, and social rules everyone else is following.</p>

<h3 id="the-society-in-one-punch-man-is-literally-killing-itself-with-bad-culture">The Society in One Punch-Man is Literally Killing Itself with Bad Culture</h3>

<p>The Hero Association is laughably inept at actually recognizing and supporting good heroes. Heroes with high social status get almost no orders at all, participating only at their whim. Heroes with low social status are mostly ignored and have to work extra hard just to stay as heroes. Only those in the middle, who are skilled, but not a threat to social status, are used at all. This means that The Hero Association values status above all, even above lives lost or damage done. Maintaining an image is their only priority.</p>

<p>The people of this society aren’t much better. They mostly love the beautiful heroes who match their expectations of what a hero should look like and behave. This bias is so strong, they are shown to doubt their own eyes when Saitama saves them, choosing to give credit elsewhere or call him a cheater. They would rather a socially prestigious hero save them, rather than being saved at all.</p>

<p>Finally, the heroes are mostly terrible. With a few exceptions, they all focus on fame and prestige. They have no interest in supporting those with the skills or ability to save the day but are more interested in beating down those of real competence as they see them as threats. All of this behavior continually puts the whole world at risk of annihilation.</p>

<h3 id="why-saitamas-victories-are-so-damn-satisfying">Why Saitama’s Victories are So Damn Satisfying</h3>

<p>The monsters of One Punch-Man are McGuffins, just there to move the plot along. They present the threat that reveals the inadequacy of society and traditions. Saitama’s “save the day” punch in each episode doesn’t just save the day, it makes the people in the story come face-to-face with their own stupid prejudices, social hierarchies, and assumptions about what it means to be a hero.</p>

<p>​The reason that Saitama’s effortless victories are so satisfying is that it rubs all these prejudices and misconceptions into the faces of the corrupt society he is living in. Every time he kills a monster, the people of the world have to wonder if maybe a hero doesn’t look, act, or come from where they think it does. The greatest hero in their world is standing right in front of them, and they can’t see it. Never is this more clear than the aftermath of the Sea King battle, or when Saitama was “framed” for the fallout of the meteor.</p>

<h3 id="yes-saitama-is-relatable">Yes, Saitama is Relatable</h3>

<p>Here’s the ultimate reason One Punch-Man is so addictive: Many of us actually relate to Saitama. Some “experts” who analyze this show assume that Genso or Mumen Rider are there to give us someone to relate to, but they are missing the point. While none of us feel invincible or powerful like Saitama, many of us feel underappreciated or under-utilized in society.</p>

<p>Instead, life is exhausting as we always feel like we have to prove ourselves to others in weird external and shallow ways, rather than our ability to do a job well or work hard. Those who look good, or say the right things, get credit for results because it makes others above them look good. Those of us who keep our noses down, and do the work, get passed up, just like Saitama.</p>

<h3 id="the-real-plot-of-one-punch-man">The Real Plot of One Punch-Man</h3>

<p>The real “will they, won’t they” of One Punch-Man that builds doubt and uncertainty is wondering if society will be able to accept and appreciate Saitama before they get themselves killed, or kill themselves by elevating shallow and destructive “heroes” to the point where it is too late to turn back. Will they learn to see through the false image of Amai Mask? Will they stop depending on the obviously nefarious Metal Knight? Will they accept a bald, untheatric hero like Saitama, or reject him at their own cost?</p>

<p>And, of course, how profound that this series is so popular now as the scientists, engineers, and social servants trying to save the real world from disaster are overlooked continuously for celebrities, athletes, loud-mouths, and people of high social status who have no interest in the common good. We overlook the humble, hard-working, and competent at our own cost while we chase images of prestige and glory. Who knows, our own world may end just as Saitama saves his… if he still wants to.</p>
