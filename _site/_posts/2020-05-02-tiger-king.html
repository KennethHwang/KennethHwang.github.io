<h3 id="thoughts-about-the-show">Thoughts about the show</h3>
<p>Episode 1—pretty ok/whatever<br />
Episode 2—became my one of favorite docu-series ever and a masterful work of art imo</p>

<p>Episode 2 was like watching the best stand up comedians: piercing social commentary that’s easily accessible due to the ridiculousness and extremity of the situation and characters.<br />
Makes it suuuuper clear for audiences to see how ridiculous everyone in the show is.<br />
Yet at the same time, the audience/viewers may realize that they themselves are in just a slightly less extreme version of basically the same situation
For example, what these insane people all have in common is their greed, exploitation and ability to manipulate and control others to get them to do what they want—just as the ultra wealthy exploit, manipulate, and control the rest of society to do their bidding for them, brainwashing the general public into adopting consumerist, materialistic beliefs that ultimately mainly serve the personal agenda of the ultra wealthy</p>

<p>All manipulative, greedy, prioritizes and cares more about money than anything, willing to exploit whatever they can for more money, even if it means becoming violent
Hypocrite masking herself behind fighting for a just cause
Doesn’t even pay her exploited volunteer workers, she doesn’t even know their names
Others are outraged, but mainly jealous due to their inability to exploit as well</p>

<p>The manipulation and exploitation of these insane people reminded me of how our society is currently structured and set up and how our upbringing and institutionalization into society is is extremely similar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Caste/Tier system</li>
  <li>Manipulating and institutionalizing people into pursuing their self-serving goal</li>
  <li>‘What else are they going to do? Quit? Where will they go?’</li>
</ul>

<p>Feeling obligated to go into work despite being sick or feeling bad to call in sick?? (esp during a pandemic lmao) is a perfect common example of how we are exploited and manipulated</p>

<p>Pandemic might finally get more work from home</p>

<p>systematically cultivating and exploiting the most desperate</p>

<p>It seems to me that society is basically a cult, a boring dystopia where we are systematically getting fucked and have no real power to stop it as far as I know. Maybe there is a way or will be one, but nothing as far as I can see.</p>

<p>I do think its important to keep hoping, believing, trying, searching for a way while learning to manage fear, anger, hatred, and frustrations, no matter how fatiguing it is.</p>

<p>Of course these are all just my own cynical views and opinions.</p>
